# Multi Position Auto Clicker
Learn, play/pause, and reset the list of mouse positions to click. With simple keyboard shortcuts.

Some games need you to click as fast as you can, in more than one place on the screen. This program was made to solve that problem. It is easy to add new places you want clicked (ALT+Z), or remove all of them and start over (ALT+C). Just let it run in the background and use the keyboard to tell it what to do.

# How to install
1. Install Python 3.7 (you may need the 32-bit version)
2. Open Start > Command Prompt
  - type: pip install pyautogui
  - type: pip install keyboard
3. If you get errors, open Start > Command Prompt but use *Run as Administrator*
4. If you *still* get errors, try Python 3.7 (or newer) but download the 32 bit version
5. Download the script autoClicker.py

# How to use
- Double click the script autoClicker.py
- A window opens. Move this to the side, and watch what happens.
- Put the target program on screen where you'll leave it running. Don't move it once you start learning mouse positions.
- Press _ALT+Z_ to learn a mouse position for clicking. This does not click, just saves the mouse position.
- Press _ALT+X_ to play/pause auto clicking 
- Press _ALT+C_ to reset (clear) all mouse positions 
- Press _ALT+Q_ to exit
